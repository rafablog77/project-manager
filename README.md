#   Project Manager
#### i guess the name explains

This is a simple tool that i made with PyQt to manage projects, nothing too fancy.

## Features
* View project in folders with a frendly gui
* Quick delete projects (useful on Jetbrains IDE's)
* Export a project to a .zip file for transfer
* Open your project's folder with the click of a button
* Works with any type of program or software (the projects need to be in a centralized folder, and projects need to be folders)

## Usage
WIP (when the first version comes out it will be done)
